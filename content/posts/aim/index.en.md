**AI Mathematician (AIM)** represents our first step toward *fully automated frontier mathematical research*.  
It explores how large reasoning models can move beyond competition-level problem solving to genuine mathematical discovery ‚Äî through exploration, memory, and verification mechanisms that enable long-horizon, rigorous reasoning.

## üß† What Is AIM?

AIM is an **LLM-based multi-agent framework** designed to perform mathematical research with minimal human intervention.  
It comprises three core agents operating in two interlocking loops:

- **Explorer** ‚Üí proposes conjectures and drafts detailed proofs through open-ended reasoning.  
- **Verifier** ‚Üí rigorously evaluates proofs using a *pessimistic* criterion.  
- **Refiner** ‚Üí revises and corrects proofs based on verifier feedback.

Together they form:
- an **exploration loop** enabling long-horizon reasoning, and  
- a **refinement loop** ensuring rigor and reliability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Techniques

### 1) Exploration and Memory Mechanism
When faced with a new problem, the **Explorer** first surveys the landscape ‚Äî generating conjectures, testing partial ideas, and storing promising lemmas in **memory**. Verified lemmas are then reused to guide deeper reasoning, much like how human mathematicians build on prior results.

### 2) Pessimistic Reasonable Verification (PRV)
Verification is notoriously difficult. To simulate rigorous peer review, the **Verifier** performs multiple independent reviews and adopts the *worst* judgment as final. If any reviewer flags an error, the proof is rejected. This conservative rule sharply increases reliability and mirrors real-world academic standards.

## üß© Experiments on Frontier Problems

We evaluated AIM on **four research-level mathematical topics**:

Across all cases, AIM autonomously constructed substantial portions of proofs and uncovered **non-trivial intermediate results**. Many were reviewed as *mathematically meaningful* and directly helpful for ongoing research.

## üìà What We Learned

- **Exploration matters:** Iterative lemma-building dramatically enhances long-chain reasoning.  
- **Verification is crucial:** PRV curbs over-confident but flawed reasoning.  
- **Human‚ÄìAI synergy:** In several topics, AIM‚Äôs partial proofs directly inspired further human discoveries.

## üí¨ Reflections

We view AIM not as a finished product but as a **proof of concept** that large reasoning models can begin to participate in open-ended mathematical research. With proper scaffolding ‚Äî exploration, memory, and verification ‚Äî LRMs can shift from *solving problems* to *doing research*.

## üîÆ What‚Äôs Next

1. **Formal verification:** Integrate with Lean / Coq for machine-checked proofs.  
2. **Autonomous discovery:** Move from solving to proposing new conjectures.  
3. **Multimodal reasoning:** Include diagrams, visual intuition, and symbolic manipulation.  
4. **Collaborative agents:** Enable multiple AIMs to critique and refine each other‚Äôs work.

We believe these directions will accelerate the transition from *AI solving mathematics* to *AI creating mathematics*.

## üåü Closing Thoughts

The **AI Mathematician** represents an early yet concrete step toward the dream of fully automated mathematical research. Many proofs remain partial, and human insight is still indispensable ‚Äî but each iteration brings us closer to an era where **AI and human mathematicians work side-by-side to expand the frontiers of knowledge.**
